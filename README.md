# NEM_ANALYSIS

 Due to my interets in the NEM and market trading I pulled toghter a few different data sources to make some graphs and stuff

 The question I asked was, "if the load profile of a whole state was my retail book load profile how would I hedge it?"

 By taking each states historical data and also the ASX Energy Futures a process of this was determined

 As each states spot pricing is closly related to the demand load profile I randomly assigned a load prfile from one stae to use with the pricing of another to make the heding process more interesting.

 The demand that AEMO publishes is the operation?? demand (need to check this)
